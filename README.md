# q2apro-follow-question
Question2Answer Plugin: Sends emails to users about activities on questions they have favorited

## Features

- Problem 1: When you post a question and you receive an answer, you get notified by email, but if this answer gets a comment, you get no notification!
- Problem 2: If you have not posted in the thread, you never get any notification!
- Solution: With this plugin users can follow any question with or without participating in the thread!
- This plugin uses the favorite feature, if the user favorites a question he gets an email notification on each activity (comments, answers).
- Instead of the favorite star there is a follow button (see widget) that can be visibly placed in the sidepanel.
