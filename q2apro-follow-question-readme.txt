# q2apro Premium Plugin: Follow Question Activities

# Description

	Sends emails to users about all activities on questions they have favorited.


# Features

    - Problem 1: When you post a question and you receive an answer, you get notified by email, but if this answer gets a comment, you get no notification!
    - Problem 2: If you have not posted in the thread, you never get any notification!
    - Solution: With this plugin users can follow any question with or without participating in the thread!
    - This plugin uses the favorite feature, if the user favorites a question he gets an email notification on each activity (comments, answers).
	- Instead of the favorite star there is a follow button (see widget) that can be visibly placed in the sidepanel.
